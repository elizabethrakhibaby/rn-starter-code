Layout systems

1. Box Object Model
margin,border,padding,height,width: affect positioning of single element
content>padding>border>margin

2. Flex box
how some number of sibling elemnts get laid out isnide a parent
Position multiple elemnts with a common parent

APPLIED TO PARENT
- alignItems: 'stretch' (default) / 'flex-start' / 'center' / 'flex-end'
- flexDirection: 'coloun' (default) / 'row' : laid out in what direction
- justifyContent: 'flex-start' / 'center' / 'flex-end' / 'space-between' / 'space-around'
 >> Justify Content lays out children along the primary axis, which is whatever flexDirection is set to


APPLIED TO CHILD
- flex: 1 (this child will take up as much possible as possible)
- alignSelf: 'stretch' (default) / 'flex-start' / 'center' / 'flex-end' (OVERRIDES alignItems)


3. Position
How a single element gets laid out inside a parent
Used to override Box Object model + Flex Box

APPLIED TO CHILD
position: 'relative' / 'absolute'
ignored by siblings. Still obeys some flex box rules set by the parent.

APPLIED TO CHILD
- top/bottom/left/right adds extra space btw one elemnt and its sibling, so extra spacing is added AFTER eveerything is alr laid out on the screen. so if there child 1,2,3. top:10 on child 2, will cause child 2 to shift 10 units down and cover some top portion of child 3.
e.g top:10
- to make child fill up whole parent
